# CryptChat
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
- We are doing both anonymous chats and person to person DMs
Back end Work 
- We can have a JSON of usernames and passwords
    - we store the encrypted passwords and we store the key to decrypt them in the json file 
    - We can store the messages the users send in a csv file and it gets emptied after a session ends or gets stored if it's a DM 
        - The session ends once either everyone leaves or after a period of inactivity
